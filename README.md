Background
-----------

After a quick whiteboarding session, I felt the need to whip up a quick Demo over lunch to illustrate how I see React can be used.

Prerequisites
-------------

- [Node.js 6.10.0+](http://nodejs.org)

Getting Started
---------------

Check it out / clone... run:

```bash
# Use correct node / npm
nvm use

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm start
```

Developing
----------

```bash
npm run start
```

This will run a webpack server with a watch task & rebuild on any changes

Building
--------
```bash
npm run build
````

Will create a bundle in `dist/` suitable for deployment.
